		<p>Holiday's spent with family can be hard enough. Add in buying gifts and you've complicated your life even further.</p>

		<p>Hopefully this will help. And if they don't make the list... Well there's always next year (or a birthday or something).</p>

		<p>If you made it through the list and actually need to buy gifts, head over to <a href="http://theeverygirl.com/the-everygirls-2016-budget-friendly-holiday-gift-guide">The Everygirl's Gift Guide!</a></p>

		<h4>Release Question 4.</h4>
		<p>I think the link I incuded for The Everygirl site it great. It's organized really well and includes tons of fun images. I used that page as inspiration to build mine with a related topic. They have a lot of similar tags for images and paragraphs. They listed all items within the paragraph, they didn't creat a list for the gifts(which I thought was interesting)!</p>
